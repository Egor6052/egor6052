I have experience working with the Git version control system, where I managed code repositories, conducted code reviews, and coordinated collaboration among team members.

I have also worked with the Vue framework in several projects, focusing on front-end development and state management.


In addition, I possess strong skills in working with Linux, Unix, and Windows operating systems, including system administration, scripting, and workflow optimization.
I am also experienced in microcontroller programming, particularly with AVR controllers from the ATmega series, where I have developed and optimized embedded systems.
I am continuously motivated to expand my knowledge and integrate new tools and technologies to enhance efficiency and deliver high-quality results.
